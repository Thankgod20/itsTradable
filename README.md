# itsTradable - Honeypot Detection Server for Swappabe (V2)

Welcome to itsTradable, the server project designed to complement [Swappabe](https://github.com/Thankgod20/Swappabe). iTrade focuses on checking tokens for honeypots and identifying functions that can activate honeypots within the Swappabe ecosystem. The project consists of four major classes: `indexxClass.js`, `indexxEtherClass.js`, `indexxPolygonClass.js`, and `indexxUnn.js`. To initiate the project, use `green_server_multi.js` to enable a Node.js server with TLS security.

## Features

- **Honeypot Detection:** iTrade provides tools to check tokens for honeypot characteristics and identify functions that may trigger honeypots.
- **Swappabe Integration:** Designed to seamlessly integrate with [Swappabe](https://github.com/Thankgod20/Swappabe) for a comprehensive security solution.

## Project Structure

- **indexxClass.js:** Core class for general token honeypot checking.
- **indexxEtherClass.js:** Class specifically designed for Ethereum-based tokens.
- **indexxPolygonClass.js:** Class tailored for Polygon (MATIC) network tokens.
- **indexxUnn.js:** Class for detecting honeypots in unconventional scenarios.
